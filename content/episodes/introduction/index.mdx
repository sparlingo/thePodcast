### Starting something is hard...
but finishing it is harder. This podcast thing will never be done, but we're going to 
begin rolling the ball up the hill now and see how long it takes before gravity takes over again.

### Goals in the short term
We want to make 13 episodes this year, and for some of them to be actually listenable.

### Goals in the long term
We want to make 26 episodes in 2021, and start to get a following who we can interact with and learn from.
