### Starting something is hard...
but finishing it is harder. This podcast thing will never be done, but we're going to begin our 
task in faith that we can help break people out of their normal habits of thought. There is a 
classic Greek myth about a king named Sisyphus who is tasked with the task of continually rolling
a ball up a hill followed by the ball unfailingly rolling back down again. Many of use from the 
West have a faith that the arrow of morality always travels forward on it's true path, but it's
belief that the arrow has to be perpetually pushed along it's path. Many countries are struggling
currently with a loss of dynamic growth, a moral and economic malaise where cherished principles
are challenged for short-term goals.

### Goals in the short term
We want to make 13 episodes this year, and for some of them to be actually listenable. We want to
make a workflow going where we manage the technical side of the work and start builing on the 
qualitative ideas that we wish to become the coin of our realm.

### Goals in the long term
We want to make 26 episodes in 2021, and start to get a following who we can interact with and learn 
from.
