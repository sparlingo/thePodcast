I met Beren through a group of like-minded people here in SZ, specifically a group organized 
around an interest in philosophy.

I prepared a talk for the group about economics, but I made a mistake that I commonly make 
and simply went too large with things. What should have been a tight talk became kind of 
unwieldly and my plan just wasn't tenable. During my research, it became as clear as ever to me
however that economics, that is the attempt to make how the economy works simply a set of tech-
nocratic questions is simply a bit silly. Why?

> You can't take the politics out of politics

My talk was given in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, at least the non-Chinese world's 
part of it and many people are becoming armchair economists and epidemologists amonth other things.
