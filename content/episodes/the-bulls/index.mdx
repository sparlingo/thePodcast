There are a number of China Youtubers, not the ones you may have heard of, other ones. 

1. Daniel Dumbrill - Canadian businessman living in Shenzhen. He currently runs a bar in SZ, and is not a moron.
2. Nathan Rich - American national who lives on the internet by all appearances. Currenly, and forever a moron.
3. Gweilo60 - A Canadian retired to Nanning, Guangxi. About as believable as an eight-year old showing you his awesome bedroom.
