### Purpose

To tell our story about China. We want to make an old-fashioned radio serial that tells stories 
about life in China that and can connect with people who have not lived in China and who typically
have a very superficial idea about the country. China has made more structural adjustments to it's 
society in the past ~40 years than most societies do in 100 years - what are people's expectations 
of what is to come? And about what has happened? Many questions arise from the tumult of reform 
and opening, but the main question is: what is permanent in modern China? Is everything provisional?
